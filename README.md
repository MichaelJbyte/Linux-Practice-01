# Linux-Practice-01
Learning how to use Linux.

Today I begin learning how to use Linux. I will begin by starting with the LabEX [Linux Journey](https://labex.io/linuxjourney).

## Topics Covered 9/5/25 
 
Day 1 covers the basics of the Linux kernal, commonly used commands, command line shortcuts, and three labs familiarizing with all of the topics.

  Below will be the notes I took during this time:

  ### Commands

  - _man_ ____: manual for any command in linux.
    * (use h to make it easier to search for options)
  - _echo_:  repeats whatever you type.
    * (also acts like print use echo ___ > ____.txt || to insert txt)
  - _expr_: calculates any expression that follows.
  - _figlet_: prints a phrase you write in ASCII characters.
  - _pwd_: prints what directory/file you are in.
  - _cd_: changes directory. Use ~ after cd to take you to home dir
  - _ls_: shows all files and directories.
    * (can use *.filetype to list all files of that type.) [* called a wildcard]
  - _mkdir_: makes a new dir(folder).
  - _touch_: makes an empty file.
  - _cat_: displays file contents.
  - _cp_: copy. Can copy files to other files.
  - _mv_: moves any file to whatever directory listed after the file.
    * ‘..’ stands for parent dir.
  - _rm_: remove file.
  - _--help_: type after a command.
    * Like man, but gives a more concise list.

### Command Line shortcuts:

  * _Tab_ > auto fills words. Use it. 
  * _Ctrl + L_ > clears the screen.
